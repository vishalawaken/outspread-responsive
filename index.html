        <h1>Our Work</h1>
        <h4>1. School after School (SAS)</h4>
        <p>
          Education for underprivileged For those young champions who against
          all odds have not given up their dream and right to education, our
          foundation Outspread Wings extends support through our study center
          located at Jaipur, India. Students coming from limited resources
          family from different standards and different schools in nearby
          locality participate in the classes run by our SAS program. This was
          established in August 2022 and since then around 50 children have
          enrolled to this program.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Practical Computer Training</h4>
        <p>
          At the same center, our foundation has setup practical computer
          learning center with required infrastructure for those children to be
          able to cope up with current education system. Practical computer
          classes are provided where computer basics are covered depending upon
          student’s age and grade.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Goodies</h4>
        <p>
          Every child love goodies, be it from a well to do section of the
          society or someone not so privileged like children at our study
          center. We make it a point to get a smile on faces of our little one
          by distributing some goodies each month.
        </p>

        <h4>4.Local schools support</h4>
        <p>
          Schools are the temple of education and foundation of the future of
          our upcoming generation. We at times participate in programs conducted
          at nearby local schools to motivate and support them. Enthusiasms of
          teachers and students motivates us to keep going.
